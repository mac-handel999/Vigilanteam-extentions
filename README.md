# 🛡️ Cyber VigilanTeam: Link Shield

An automated, background threat intelligence browser extension designed to audit active web navigation paths. By intercepting tab routing vectors in real time, it protects users against phishing networks, malware, and credential harvest zones before page interactions occur.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Automated Target Inspection:** Hooks directly into Chrome's web navigation events to audit URLs instantly.
* **Real-Time Payload Interception:** Cross-references active host names with central proxy node engines query endpoints.
* **In-Page Threat Isolation:** Automatically injects a strict full-screen warning overlay across malicious targets, blocking traffic execution loops.
* **Rolling Inspection Logs:** Maintains an interactive session queue tracking the security telemetry configurations of your last 5 visited assets.
* **100% Client-Side Efficiency:** Runs on zero-weight vanilla JavaScript, preserving system processing resources.

## 📡 Backend Proxy Dependencies

This application communicates asynchronously with a secure, centralized API endpoint proxy router. If you are maintaining a local testing loop environment:

1. Ensure your local Node.js Express framework server (`server.js`) is listening actively on your designated port (e.g., `5500`).
2. Verify that your environment variables (`.env`) contain a valid connection signature token credential mapping for the Google Safe Browsing telemetry infrastructure registry.
